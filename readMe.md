# Quiz App – Project 1: Layout

This project is the first step in building our own mobile quiz web application.  
In this stage, you focus entirely on the layout, while functionality will be added in later projects.

## Overview

The app consists of three main pages:

- **Home Page**  
  The home page displays all questions available on the platform.  
  Users can scroll through the list of quiz cards to explore the full question pool.

- **Bookmark Page**  
  The bookmark page shows only the questions that have been bookmarked.  
  It works like a favorites list, allowing quick access to saved questions.

- **Profile Page**  
  The profile page lets users view and manage their profile information and settings.  
  This area will be extended with additional features in later steps of the project.

## Project Goals

- Build a responsive layout for a mobile web application
- Define the basic structure of all three pages using semantic HTML
- Style the interface with modern layout techniques (e.g. Flexbox, CSS Grid)
- Create a consistent design for cards, buttons, navigation, and headers

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for the structure of the pages
- **CSS3** for layout, styling, and responsiveness
- **Mobile‑first** design approach to optimize the experience on smartphones
