Recap Project 1: Quiz App - Layout
In this project you will build the layout of your first mobile web application, a quiz app. In later projects we will expand this app and add all sorts of cool functionality.

Overview
In this project we will have 3 pages:

Home page: Here, you’ll have access to view all questions available on the platform.
Bookmark page: This is a dedicated space where you can exclusively view the questions you’ve bookmarked, similar to the ones marked on the home page.
Profile page: This section allows you to view and manage your profile and settings.
